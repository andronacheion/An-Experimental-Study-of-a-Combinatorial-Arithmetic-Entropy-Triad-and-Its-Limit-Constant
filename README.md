# An-Experimental-Study-of-a-Combinatorial-Arithmetic-Entropy-Triad-and-Its-Limit-Constant
Reproducible source for a study of a combinatorial–arithmetic–entropy triad. Closed forms for two components, unconditional tail bounds for the third, and high-precision evidence for a limit constant κ with rate O((ln n)/n).
